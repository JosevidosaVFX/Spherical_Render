# Spherical_Render
HDA to Render an object from different perspectives. 

- Download the .hdalc file and put it in your otls directory (on Windows, that's usually \Documents\houdinixx.x\otls).
- Launch Houdini and the HDA should appear in the TAB Menu under the name spherical_render (only in the SOP context).
